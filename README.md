# Biosignal-Analysis-for-Smoking

#**Problem Statement->**
Over the years, the company has collected details and gathered a lot of information about individuals. 
The management wants to build an intelligent system from the data to determine the presence or absence of smoking in a person through bio-signals. 
Given a personâ€™s information, build a machine learning model that can classify the presence or absence of smoking.

#**Dataset Information->**
This dataset is a collection of basic health biological signal data which contains around 55K record with 27 attributes

#**Methodology->**
Checked distribution of data ,correlation of all variables and checking outliers
did data cleaning, feature selection with ExtraTree Classifier
build models like Logistic Regression , Decision Tree and Random Forest 

#**Key Results->**
Got highest Accuracy of ***83.88%** with Random Forest , **78.88%** with Decision Tree and **71.72** with Logistic Regression 
In this Data , Generally Male are Smokers, number is above **50%** 
Large number of data from 40 age group 

#**Tools and Libraries Used->**
Used Python(Jupyter Notebook) , libraries - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
